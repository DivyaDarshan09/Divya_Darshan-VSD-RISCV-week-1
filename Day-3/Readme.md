# Day 3 - Combinational and Sequential Optimization

This document outlines my Day 3 experience in the RISC-V SoC Tapeout project. I explored optimization techniques in digital design. I focused on how combinational and sequential logic can be improved to reduce area, delay, and power consumption while keeping the functionality correct.
