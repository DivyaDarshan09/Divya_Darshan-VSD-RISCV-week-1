# ðŸ“˜ Day 4 â€“ GLS, Blocking vs Non-Blocking & Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch  

Todayâ€™s focus was on **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)**, **blocking vs non-blocking assignments**, and how these can lead to **synthesisâ€“simulation mismatches**. The session was divided into three main parts, combining both theoretical understanding and practical lab experiments.

##  Subdivision 1: GLS & Synthesisâ€“Simulation Mismatch + Blocking/Non-Blocking Mismatch  

- **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS):**  
  GLS is performed after synthesis, using the **netlist** instead of RTL code. It helps verify whether the synthesized design behaves the same as the RTL simulation.  
  - GLS catches mismatches that arise due to coding style, synthesis tool optimizations, or blocking/non-blocking misusage.  
  - Timing effects can also be introduced during GLS.  

- **Synthesisâ€“Simulation Mismatch:**  
  - Occurs when the RTL simulation and synthesized netlist behave differently.  
  - Reasons:  
    - Incorrect sensitivity lists  
    - Use of blocking (`=`) where non-blocking (`<=`) is expected  
    - Tool-specific synthesis optimizations  

- **Blocking vs Non-Blocking Mismatch:**  
  - **Blocking (`=`):** Executes immediately and can cause order-dependent behavior.  
  - **Non-blocking (`<=`):** Updates all values concurrently at the end of the time step, matching hardware behavior more accurately.  
  - Using blocking in sequential always blocks may work in simulation but fail after synthesis.

## Subdivision 2: Labs on GLS & Synthesisâ€“Simulation Mismatch  

In this part, we:  
- Ran **GLS** on synthesized netlists.  
- Observed how mismatches appear when the RTL uses improper coding style.  
- Analyzed the waveform differences between **RTL simulation** and **post-synthesis GLS**.  

This reinforced why GLS is an **essential verification step** before moving to layout.

## Subdivision 3: Labs on Synthesisâ€“Simulation Mismatch for Blocking Statements  

- We experimented with **blocking assignments (`=`)** inside sequential blocks.  
- Observed:  
  - Simulation gave results due to the ordered execution of statements.  
  - Post-synthesis GLS failed or gave incorrect results since hardware doesnâ€™t follow the same ordered execution model.  
- Conclusion: Always use **non-blocking (`<=`)** in sequential always blocks to match real hardware behavior.

##  What I Learned Today  

1. **GLS is mandatory** to catch mismatches between RTL and netlist.  
2. Synthesis-simulation mismatch often arises from **improper coding styles**.  
3. **Blocking vs non-blocking** plays a crucial role:  
   - Use `=` for combinational logic.  
   - Use `<=` for sequential logic.  
4. Labs demonstrated that **blocking assignments** may give expected results in RTL simulation but fail in GLS.  
5. Always verify with GLS before tapeout.
