## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 2, I was able to:

- Understand the **structure and importance of timing libraries**.  
- Explore and analyze **PVT corners** and **equivalent Verilog models** of standard cells.  
- Compare **hierarchical vs flat synthesis approaches** and their trade-offs.  
- Learn **efficient flop coding styles** for better performance and area optimization.

## ✅ Wrap-Up  

From this exploration, I understood:  

- How **PVT variations** are captured in library file names.  
- How to view the **equivalent Verilog models** of cells.  
- That **different cell variants trade off area and performance**.  

This gave me a strong foundation on how timing libraries drive the **behavior, area, and delay characteristics** of standard cells.
