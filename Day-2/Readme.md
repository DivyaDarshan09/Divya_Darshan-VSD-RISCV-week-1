# Day 2 - Timing Libs, Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis & Efficient Loop Coding Styles  

---

## What I Did Today  

On Day 2, I have covered three key areas:  

1. **Introduction to Timing .libs**  
   - We examined the standard cell libraries and their importance in chip design.  

2. **Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis**  
   - We looked at two different ways to approach synthesis and discussed the trade-offs involved.  

3. **Various Flop Coding Styles and Optimizations**  
   - We talked about how different coding techniques for flops impact performance and efficiency.

## Overall Takeaway  

Today helped us understand how **timing, synthesis style, and coding choices** significantly influence the design process. Each of these topics will be valuable as we progress in the project.
