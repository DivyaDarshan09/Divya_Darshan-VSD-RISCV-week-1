## What I Learned

- Flip-flops are used to **store stable outputs** and avoid glitches in combinational circuits.  
- I learned the difference between **synchronous** and **asynchronous resets**, and how to implement and simulate both in Verilog.  
- I practiced designing **combined reset strategies** for greater flexibility.  
- I explored **optimization techniques** for multiplications using shift-based methods in Verilog.

## Key Concepts

###  Combinational Circuits and Glitches

- **Combinational circuits** produce outputs solely based on the **current inputs**.  
- Large combinational circuits are prone to **glitches** (momentary 0s or 1s due to propagation delays).  
- Flip-flops act as **storage elements**, triggering only on the **clock edge** and providing **stable outputs**.  
- Flip-flops must be **initialized** with a reset to avoid **garbage values**.

###  Flip-Flop Reset Strategies

#### Asynchronous Reset
- Triggered **independent of the clock**.  
- Immediately sets or resets the flip-flop when activated.  

#### Synchronous Reset
- Triggered **only on the active edge of the clock**.  
- Reset occurs **in sync with the clock**.  

#### Combined Reset
- Designs can include **both synchronous and asynchronous resets** for flexibility.  
- I **simulated all three cases**, observed their outputs, and synthesized using **Yosys**.

###  Optimization Techniques – Multiplication Modules

I explored **shift-based optimizations** for multiplication to **reduce hardware requirements**.  

#### MULT_2 Module
- For `A` (3-bit), `Y = 2 * A`.  
- Achieved by **left-shifting by 1 bit**.  
- Output width increases by 1 bit (3-bit input → 4-bit output).  

#### MULT_9 Module
- For `A` (3-bit), `Y = 9 * A = 8*A + A`.  
- Implemented by **concatenating `A` shifted left by 3 bits** (A*8) and **adding `A`**.  
- Example: 3-bit input `A` → 6-bit output `Y = {A, A}`.  

**Key Insight:**  
- **No hardware multipliers** are required; **wires and concatenation** are sufficient.  
- This reduces **hardware complexity**, **resource usage**, and is crucial for **efficient RTL design**.
