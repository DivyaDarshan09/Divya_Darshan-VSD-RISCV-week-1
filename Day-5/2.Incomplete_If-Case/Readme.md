# 2. Labs on Incomplete If-Case

This document explains the second subdivision of **Day 5 - Optimization in Synthesis**.  
In this section, we performed hands-on labs to understand how incomplete if statements behave during simulation and synthesis.

---

## What I Learned
- Writing incomplete if statements causes the synthesizer to infer latches, which is not good practice.  
- RTL simulation alone may not reveal hardware issues â€” synthesis analysis is also important.  
- Always complete the if-else structure to ensure predictable and optimized hardware.  
- Good coding style directly impacts the quality of synthesized circuits.

## Files Used
1. `incomp_if.v`  
2. `incomp_if_2.v`  

These files contain examples of **incomplete if statements**.

---

## Concept: Incomplete If Statement
- An **incomplete if** occurs when an `else` branch is missing.  
- In synthesis, this results in **inferred latches** because the output retains its previous value when no condition is true.  
- This is considered a **bad coding style** and should be avoided.

## 1. 1st Example (incomp_if.v)


### Code Analysis
The Verilog source code clearly shows missing else conditions.

### RTL Simulation
We first ran an RTL simulation to observe the output behavior of the incomplete if statements.

### Synthesis
After synthesis, we observed that the synthesizer inferred latches to hold the output when conditions were not met.

## 2. 2nd Example (incomp_if_2.v)


### Code Analysis
The Verilog source code clearly shows missing else conditions.

## Observations
- Incomplete if statements result in **latch inference**.  
- Simulation may still run correctly, but synthesis introduces additional hardware to hold values.  
- To avoid this, always write **complete if-else statements**.
