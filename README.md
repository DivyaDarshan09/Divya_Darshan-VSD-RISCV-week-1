##  What I learned
- Understood the need of simulator and synthesizer.
- Got hands on with digital designs using the tools.
- Understood the importance of library files (.lib) and the cells present in it
- Understood the flow of synthesis and types of synthesis using the synthesizer `yosys`
- Understood the combinational and sequential design optimization in rtl
- Understood the concept and need of Gate level Simulation, blocking & non-blocking contructs and synthesis-simulation mismatch.
- Understood how optimization makes the design simple and reduce the area and power of a chip.
- Finally realized efficient coding styles for flops, looping constructs, combinational and sequential logic.

---

## Next Steps
- Continue documenting tasks for upcoming weeks.
- Maintain consistency in structure for all weeks.
