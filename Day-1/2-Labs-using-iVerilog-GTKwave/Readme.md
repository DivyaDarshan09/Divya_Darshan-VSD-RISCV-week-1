# 2. Labs using iVerilog & GTKwave

In this subdivision, I worked on **practical labs** using iVerilog and GTKwave to simulate and verify RTL designs.  

---

## üéØ What I Learned
During these sessions, I learned:  
- How to organize my workspace by creating a **VSD folder** and a **VLSI subfolder** for lab files.  
- How to **clone a GitHub repository** containing the Sky130 RTL designs (from Kunal Ghosh sir) and explore its contents.  
- How to use **iVerilog** to compile and simulate a design module along with its testbench.  
- How to generate a **VCD file** from the simulation and visualize the output using **GTKwave**.  
- How to analyze module and testbench files using **gvim**.

## üîπ Lab Setup
1. Created the following folder structure on my machine:  
            VSD -> VLSI
2. Cloned the Sky130 RTL repository (https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git) into the `VLSI` folder.  
3. Explored the repository files to understand the organization and RTL modules.

## üîπ Simulation with iVerilog
- Took the example **mux** design: `good_mux.v`  
- Used the testbench: `tb_good_mux.v`  
- Simulated using the command:  
```bash
iverilog  good_mux_tb good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v  ## create executable file (a.out)
./a.out ## dump the vcd file and create tb_good_mux.vcd
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd ## Used to view the waveform
```
## üîπ Viewing Results in GTKwave

I opened the generated VCD file in **GTKwave** to visualize the output.  

I observed how input changes affected the output, verifying that the design worked correctly.

## üîπ File Analysis

In the second part of the lab, I analyzed the **module** and **testbench** files using **gvim**.  

I learned how to navigate through the code and understand signal connections and behavior.

## üìù Notes

The general commands to create a executable file of a design and run the simulation using iVerilog and gtkwave are:  

```bash
iverilog  < module_name.v > < testbench_name.v >
./a.out
gtkwave < testbench_name.vcd > 

```
